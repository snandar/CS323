<h1>Persistent Left-leaning Red Black Tree</h1>

<h4>Written in Java</h4>

<p>
In this program, I implemented a persistent version of the left-leaning red-black tree, with just the "put" method. 
The program uses the "lazy delete" method. 

In a persistent data structure, each "version" of the data structure remains around unchanged, available for further operations.  A
"modifying" operation returns a new version of the data structure, but also leaves the original version unchanged.

For more on this idea, see:
